### Overview

#### About the game

With mental math still being an important part of children's formative education, we wanted to build an app that would mainly help these younger groups of people become more engaged with the subject and flourish in class as a result.

Grandmathster gives players the choice of answering questions on addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. Within this simple interface, the app allows different levels of customization to each game mode - such as the option to select your desired number of questions to solve or to focus on specific digits only (e.g. exclusively working on multiples of 7). Additionally, players are able to keep track of their top scores and unlock different badges throughout the game.

As the skills developed by playing are also useful in different working fields, the game can also be enjoyed by adults. A more detailed view on using the app, with in-game examples, is provided in the 'Playing the game' section below.

#### Technology Stack

[![ReactNative][ReactNative]][ReactNative-url]  [![Expo][Expo]][Expo-url]

Grandmathster was written in React Native and made use of Expo for building, testing, and deploying purposes.

We are excited to present Grandmathster to you and hope it improves your mathematical skills. Enjoy!
